1. We have 2 hashes for the full password that is entered. Then we have 12 hashes for the letters that were inputed. "s" + "e" + "c" + "r" + "e" + "t" is 6, and there was 2 passwords with the same amount of letters, mkaing it 12. We then have three numbers at the end of the password input. For each digit, integers 0-9 are replaced except the original number to try every variation. Cause there is 3 numbers and 9 integers were tested, there would be 27 hashes. Because there are two passwords with the same amount of numbers, it would be 54 hashes. In total, 2 + 12 + 54, which would be 68 hases for testing.
2. For checking duplicates, we look at the passwords. Even though they say have the same characters,
